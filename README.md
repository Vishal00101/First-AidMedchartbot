# First-AidMedchartbot
We started this project to provide immediate first aid information during natural disasters, using NLP and machine learning to offer quick and reliable guidance. The First Aid Chatbot provides quick, reliable first aid information during natural disasters. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning, it understands user queries and offers relevant first aid advice. The chatbot uses Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for tokenizing and tagging inputs, and the Levenshtein distance algorithm to find the best match for the user's query in its database. Built with Flask, it features an easy-to-use web interface. This tool aims to deliver lifesaving information promptly, improving survival rates and health outcomes during disasters by offering immediate first aid guidance and reducing the burden on emergency services.
